## 2026-02-12 — Phase 1.1: Build PDF Extraction Pipeline

### Dependencies
- **Installed:** `pdfjs-dist` (v5.4.624) and `canvas` (node-canvas) for server-side PDF rendering

### `src/lib/ai/pdf-extractor.ts` (new)
- **Created:** PDF page extraction utility with three functions:
  - `extractPdfPages(pdfUrl, scale)` — fetches a PDF from URL, renders all pages to PNG buffers at 2x scale
  - `extractSinglePage(pdfUrl, pageNumber, scale)` — extracts a single page (for testing/incremental processing)
  - `getPdfPageCount(pdfUrl)` — returns page count without rendering (for progress tracking)
- **Implementation:** Uses `pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.mjs` with custom `NodeCanvasFactory` for server-side canvas rendering
- **Output:** Returns `PdfExtractionResult` / `ExtractedPdfPage` types from the structured output schema

### `docs/tasks.md`
- **Marked complete:** "Build PDF extraction pipeline" in section 1.1
